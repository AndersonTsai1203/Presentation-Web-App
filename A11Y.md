1. Our website utilises a clear and contrasting color scheme of blue and white, which is especially helpful for users with color vision impairments, such as those who are red-green colorblind. This design ensures that all users can easily read and navigate our site.

2. We've also focused on making our website accessible through keyboard inputs. This is particularly useful for users who need to fill out forms or navigate the site using a keyboard instead of a mouse, catering to those with physical limitations or a preference for keyboard use.

3. Furthermore, we've implemented consistent navigation throughout our site. This means that no matter where users are on the website, they can expect a uniform navigation experience, which makes it easier to learn and use our site more efficiently. This consistent approach helps in building a user-friendly environment that welcomes everyone.
