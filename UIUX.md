1. Our website is designed with similarities to the COMP6080 website, incorporating common color schemes and layouts. This familiarity allows users to quickly notice that the logout button is conveniently located in the top right-hand corner. If users fail to provide sufficient information in a modal, they can't proceed to the next stage. However, we provide helpful error messages that clearly explain what information is missing and how to correct it, which helps reduce user frustration.

2. We've kept our design consistent, using a blue color theme and a layout where the header is always at the top of each page. This consistent placement ensures that users can easily find the logout button on any page. In our presentation section, we've grouped buttons in a way that makes them easier to use: one group for editing the presentation itself and another for the slide components. This arrangement improves user efficiency.

3. Additionally, our website is optimized for easy navigation, requiring only two clicks to go from registration to the landing slide page. We also focus on a minimalist and aesthetic design approach, displaying only the essential information and controls on each page to enhance user experience and avoid clutter.
